Example 2: Cohesive energy vs lattice constant curve

Test Driver
----------

This test driver is designed to compute a cohesive a cohesive energy-versus-lattie constant curve for a cubic lattice of a given species.
The main difference between this example and the first is that the Test used here performs a query to the OpenKIM repository to retrieve
the correpsonding ...


The script begins by reading the Model name, atomic species, atomic mass and lattice type from stdin. The parameters which determine the precise
lattice spacings for which the cohesive energy will be computed are then read in, beginning with the corresponding equilibrium lattice
constant for the Model specified. After some error checking, the array of lattice constants is computed and substitutued along with the KIM
model name, atomic species etc into lammps.in.template using sed and written to a file named lammps.in in the Test result directory.

The LAMMPS input script for this example utilizes the next and jump commands within LAMMPS in order to loop over the set of lattice constatns, and the result for each lattice constant is successively concatenated onto lammps.log.

lammps.in.template
------------------


As in the first eample, this specific test driver processes the template below using sed with the information entered on stdin through
pipeline.stdin.tpl. The processed is then written to the final LAMMPS input script which is run (output/lammps.in). Note that when using a
KIM model within lammps.
