  Tree structured-program looking at MPI_Broadcast 
  
  A communiation pattern that involves all the processes in a communiator is a 
  collective communication. As a consequence, a collective commmunication involves more 
  than two processes. 

  A broadcast is a collective communcation in which a single process
  sends the same data to every proceess in the communicator.
