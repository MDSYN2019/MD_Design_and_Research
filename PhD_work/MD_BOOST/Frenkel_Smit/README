Casestudies
19,20,21,22,23,24 have been written by Thijs J.H. Vlugt; Casestudy
27 written by Thijs J.H. Vlugt and Maddalena Venturoli. Additional
material about molecular simulations can be found on the web:
http://molsim.chem.uva.nl/course/material.html

To compile the source of a Casestudy, simply type "make" in the
directory containing the source code. All makefiles have been prepared
for RedHat Linux 6.1 (Cartman) on an i386 using the GNU compilers. For
other Unix systems, the Makefile may have to be modified. The random
number generator provided in this distribution was written in C
(ran_uniform.c) for some Casestudies. Some care have to be taken,
because some compilers put underscores after FORTRAN77
subroutines. For example, for SGI machines ran_uniform__ has to be
changed into ran_uniform_ (see Tools/ran_uniform_SGI.c).

We have done our best to remove all errors from this document and the
programs. However, we have to make the following statement:

We make no warranties, express or implied, that the programs contained
in this work are free of error, or that they will meet your
requirements for any particular application. They should not be
relied on for solving problems whose incorrect solution could results
in injury, damage, or loss of property. The authors and publishers
disclaim all liability for direct or consequential damages resulting
from your use of the programs.
